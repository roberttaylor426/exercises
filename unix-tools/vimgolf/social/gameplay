I would like to host a round of Vim Golf!

Over the course of an hour, players will hack their way around 9 challenging Vim refactoring holes in an attempt to hone their skills and share nifty trick shots. Players of all abilities welcome, no handicap required!



Instructions:

Checkout repo containing folders for each of the holes, each with a file containing the challenge. Each folder should have a script to submit the solution.

How will we share the solutions with others? Each round someone will talk us through their solution.


Ideas:

Holes should have pars.

Return YouTube link upon solution submission.
